# TODO

1. improve M4RI reduction on any lvl -- store rref as matrix on every lvl to be reused?! -- re-activate 'assignments'?
2. add Vivification -- simplifying learnt clauses?
3. remove openMP (and 'get_thread_num()' calls)
4. create benchmarks from simple stream cipher (random LFSR + Ascon-SBox?)
5. find replacement for 'robin_hood.h' fast hash-maps... library is wrong!
6. implement removal of equivs on dl 0
